# Weapon-Detection-Using-Python-OpenCV

📌 Overview

This project implements a weapon detection system using Python and OpenCV. The system processes images or real-time video feeds to detect weapons, aiming to enhance security and surveillance applications.

🚀 Features

1) Real-time weapon detection using OpenCV

2) Image and video processing support

3) Custom-trained model for improved accuracy

4) Alerts when a weapon is detected

5) Scalable and adaptable for various use cases

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

1) Python (Core programming language)

2) OpenCV (cv2) (For image and video processing)

3) NumPy (Handling arrays and computations)

4) imutils (For image processing utilities)

5) DateTime (For timestamping detections)

📂 Installation & Setup

1) Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weapon-detection-opencv.git
cd weapon-detection-opencv
```
2) Install dependencies:
```
pip install opencv-python numpy imutils
```
3) Run the detection script:
```
python weapon_detection.py
```
🎯 How It Works

1) Pre-trained Model: Uses OpenCV and trained models (e.g., YOLO or Haar cascades) to detect weapons in images/videos.

2) Frame Processing: Extracts frames from video streams and applies detection models.

3) Alert Mechanism: Uses DateTime to log detection events.

🔥 Future Enhancements

1) Improve detection accuracy with a deep learning-based model

2) Add integration with security systems for real-time alerts

3) Deploy as a web-based or mobile application
